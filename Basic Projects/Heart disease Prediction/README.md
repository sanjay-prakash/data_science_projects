# Predicting heart disease
In this ML project,I have collected dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) .This project is used to predict whether any person is suffering from heart disease.

I have used 5 classification algorithms to classify whether the person had heart disease or not,
  > 1.KNeighborsClassifier
  > 2.DecisionTreeClassifier
  > 3.RandomForestClassifier
  > 4.Logistic Regression
  > 5.Artificial Neural Network
