# Predicting heart disease
In this ML project,I have collected dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) .This project is used to predict whether any person is suffering from heart disease.

I have used 5 classification algorithms to classify whether the person had heart disease or not,
   - KNeighborsClassifier
   - DecisionTreeClassifier
   - RandomForestClassifier
   - Logistic Regression
   - Artificial Neural Network
